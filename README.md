# Machine_Failure_Detection
The dataset for this task (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Machine Failure Predictions. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original

## Directory Structure
- [eda-featureengineering-prediction.ipynb](./eda-featureengineering-prediction.ipynb):Notebook contains comparitive study about various statistical ways of comingup with importent features a comparitive study among multiple models.
- [train.csv](./train.csv): the training dataset; Machine failure is the (binary) target (which, in order to align with the ordering of the original dataset, is not in the last column position)
- [test.csv](./test.csv): the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of Machine failure..
